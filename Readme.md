# 👨 VISIONFIT : AI EYEWEAR TRY-ON ASSISTANT USING DEEP LEARNING APPROACH

# 📖 Project Overview

This project is a web-based intelligent system that detects a user’s face shape and recommends suitable eyewear styles with real-time AR try-on functionality. It uses MTCNN for face detection and a VGG16-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for face shape classification. Based on the predicted face shape, a rule-based module suggests appropriate frame types, which are then overlaid onto the user’s face using webcam input. The system integrates computer vision, deep learning, and web technologies to create a practical virtual eyewear experience. This project was developed for academic purposes as part of a Final Year Project in Intelligent Systems Engineering.
